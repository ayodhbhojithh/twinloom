/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A card with pieces taken out of it.

   Three things sit against the card rather than on it: a bar of controls at the
   top, the next project at the bottom left, and the way on at the bottom right.
   The card is cut back around each, and the cuts curve outward where they meet
   the edge, so the shape reads as one continuous surface with bites out of it
   rather than as four rectangles overlapping.

   Those outward curves are the whole job. `border-radius` only ever bends a
   corner inward, and a mask made of gradients gets the straight edges right and
   the corners visibly wrong. The outline is written as a path instead: every
   corner is an arc, and which side of the arc its centre falls on decides
   whether the surface curves in or out.
